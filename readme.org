* About

This package implements a minor mode to enable checkboxes in headings in
style of org-mode checkboxes as used in lists. It is very light and simple.

This is not a package yet, but if I get good feedback on this one, I am thinking
of making it into a Melpa package.

* Installation

To install either clone this repo, or just download org-heading-checkbox.el
somewhere where your Emacs can find it. Alternatively you can also download it
and install it with: 

`M-x package-install-file'. 

* Usage

Enable the mode with M-x org-heading-checkbox-mode, or from lisp with:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-heading-checkbox-mode 1)
#+end_src

You could also add it to org-mode-hook:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (org-heading-checkbox-mode 1))).
#+end_src

Create a heading with either "[ ]" or "[x]" after the leading stars, but beffore
the heading text. Number of spaces after stars and before the heading itself
does not matter. Now you have a heading with a checkbox. You can place point
somewhere on the heading line, and use S+up/down to toggle the checkbox.

Currently S+up/down arrows are already bound by org-mode, but so is every other
possible modifier or modifier combination. They have really seen to use every
meaningful key combo for something in org, which leaves any third party or user
with only option to overwrite something, or define own prefixes. I have done it
so that keys will toggle on/off the checkbox when a heading has one, but when
there is not one, it will just do whatever org-mode already does. But feel free to
redefine keys to your liking.

Sometimes just having a graphical representation of something enabled or
disabled is enough. But often times, we would also like something to happen when
we disable or enable a checkbox. I haven't come to implement this functionality
yet, it is on TODO list :). I will do this via text properties, but I haven't
had time yet to implement it.

However, there are two general hooks defined, which you can use in usual Emacs
manner to add your own hooks which will be run when you toggle a checkbox. Yes
it is very limited use indeed, but for now it is all there is to it.

If you manually place point between square braces and change char to something
else than x or space, or even toggle the box, the heading will not be recognized
as a checkbox heading. Depending on your view it is a feature or a bug.

* Issues

This is a work in progress, both conceptually and implementation wise. Hook per
checkbox to be implemented. Trees of headings are not implemented
either. Probably lots of bugs in regard with other org-features. Feedback is
welcome.
